# Python-R---Turtle-Games
In this assigment, I took on a role as part of a data analysis team contracted by Turtle Games, a global manufacturer and retailer of games and toys. Our objective was to enhance overall sales performance by analyzing customer engagement and trends.

1. I created a Jupyter Notebook (IPYNB) and an R script to analyze sales and customer review data. This included visualizations and metrics aimed at informing decision-making, while adhering to best practices in coding and documentation.
2. I explored how customers engage with the loyalty points program, identifying patterns and behaviors that could inform marketing strategies.
3. I segmented customers into distinct groups for targeted marketing, utilizing data-driven insights to enhance engagement and retention.
4. I examined customer reviews to extract sentiment and key themes, providing insights for potential marketing campaigns and product improvements.
5. I applied descriptive statistics to assess the suitability of the loyalty points data for creating predictive models, analyzing aspects like normal distribution, skewness, and kurtosis.
